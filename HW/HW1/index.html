                    Robotics have become more emergent in the world as we progress so I decided to show them in this site to display their current immersion. The study of robotics has been increasing at the college and lower educational levels as well as the uses they are being developed for in the world. Robotics is an interdisciplinary science that is being used to solve problems current around the world.
