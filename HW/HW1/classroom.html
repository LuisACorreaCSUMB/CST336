                In recent years, LEGO, along with a few other corporations, have been developing robotics programs that introduce robotics and programming at a young age to elementary school children. LEGO Robotics is a program that has now been running for many years and teaches children engineering, teamwork, and basic programming ideas based off of java. EV3 robotics are the current models and include sensors for temperature, distance, color, and can be controlled via cellphone or preprogrammed instructions. LEGO also developed a competition to encourage young kids to look at problems currently prevalent in the world and to find ways to solve them then give them a place to showcase those ideas.
